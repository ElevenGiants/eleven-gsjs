Ilmenskie Jones and the Sparkly Femur? Ringing any bells?<split butt_txt=\"Not a tinkle.\" \/>OK, wow. Well, he’s only the most famous adventurer in all of Ur. And he’s a senior lecturer in porkthropology at Porcine University. In short, he’s dreamy.<split butt_txt=\"Never heard of him.\" \/>Well he’s heard of you. He left a note in his office when he set off to explore the infamous Sealed Cavern of <a href=\"event:location|106#LHFIV4V8J6J2I7U\">Axis Denyde<\/a>. \"If you don’t hear from me within a week,\" it read, \"please notify whats-their-name. You know, the pedantic one\" He could only have meant you, sure as eggs is eggs.<split butt_txt=\"ARE eggs, surely?\" \/> See?!? Clearly you. So using your newly acquired powers of Teleportation IV, perhaps you could hop right on over to him and help him out? Problem is, it being a sealed cavern, the entrance is blocked off. So you'll need to locate <a href=\"event:location|106#LHFIV4V8J6J2I7U\">Axis Denyde<\/a> in <a href=\"event:location|106\">Pollokoo<\/a> on the map, and then teleport in that way. Would you mind checking in to see what’s taking him so long?";
var completion = "What a guy, huh, kid?<split butt_txt=\"He seemed kind of…\" \/>Amazing? I know. Man, if I could teleport using the map, like him or, well, like you? Imagine the jinks I could get up to… <split butt_txt=\"I can take you with me…\" \/>Sweet thought, kid. Let's do that: whenever the mood takes you - well, a few times a day for free, and more with tokens - just open the map, choose a street to teleport to, and click! We'll be off! Exploring! That's cheered me up. Let me do the same for you (as if meeting Ilmenskie Jones wasn’t already reward enough).";
