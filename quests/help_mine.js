Sometimes mining is tough on your own, but if you have a friend helping you, it gets way easier… and more fun, like squash. <split butt_txt=\"I don’t think squash comes in jars.\" \/> No, I mean with the rackets and—you know what? Just forget the analogies for a minute. Find someone who’s working on a rock and help them mine by mining at the same time. Do it three times. Can you manage that?
