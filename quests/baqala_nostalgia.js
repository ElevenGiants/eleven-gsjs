Welcome to the savanna. Millions of years ago, these sun-blasted plains were where the giants imagined some of your predecessors out of the stygian depths of antediluvian mind-stuff… \r\n<split butt_txt=\"Huh?\"> \r\nWhat you're feeling is the weight of aeons pressing on your heart. \r\n<split butt_txt=\"I can't tell if I like it or not.\">\r\nIt's supposed to feel like that, kid, but don't stay too long – your overwhelminess will force you to flee to safety, unless…\r\n<split butt_txt=\"Unless what?\">\r\nUnless you can find a tangible way to connect to your ancestors. This place used to be teeming with them. They must have left some remnants. I'm talking microscopic, though, teeny-tiny bits and bobs: the golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticula, vacuoles, super old mitochondrial DNA, the pileated gibbon…\r\n<split butt_txt=\"Isn't that some kind of ape?\"> \r\nWhatever. The dust traps that snap on the streets round here usually shake something loose. Try to find as many of those as you can, and I bet you can hold on to that feeling for a little bit longer. And if you can find three of them, I might have something extra for you. \r\n<split butt_txt=\"OK, I'll do it!\">\r\nJust be careful out here—a group of mean-spirited mothers calling themselves the Juju Bandits have claimed the savanna as their own, and they don't take too kindly to strangers.";

You've got pretty sharp eyes to spot three of those wee-tiny remnants in all this dust.<split butt_txt=\"Does that mean I can stay?\">For a little while, and collecting even more remnants will help you stay for a little longer still, but I'm afraid nothing lasts forever.";
