No-one said anything about a cubimal that looks like you.<split butt_txt=\"Aww. What then?\" \/>Many of the inhabitants of Ur have cubimals that look like them. Also, low self-esteem. It would greatly improve the mood of the world if their vanity were tickled a bit.<split butt_txt=\"I'm a champion tickler!\" \/>That you are! But don't get too touchy-feely. I just need you to find 7 different cubimals and deliver them to the Ur-inhabitant they resemble. Can you do that for me?<split butt_txt=\"Do I get a cubimal that looks like me?\" \/>No. But maybe some other stuff. And the pride that comes from a job well done.<split butt_txt=\"Sigh. Ok, I'll do it!\" \/>";

By my calculations the collective mood of Ur has been raised precisely 0.324%, thanks to your hard work.<split butt_txt=\"That's not much!\" \/>It's significantly more than zero.<split butt_txt=\"You have an odd way of looking at things.\" \/>Perhaps, but... look, do you want these rewards or not?<split butt_txt=\"Yes please!\" \/>";
