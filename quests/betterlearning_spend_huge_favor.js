Those glorious little <b>Emblems<\/b> you get from donating to <b>Giants<\/b>. <split butt_txt=\"Really?\" \/> Oh yes. Your favor limit with a <b>Giant<\/b> increases with each subsequent <b>Emblem<\/b>. So multiple Emblems make for bigtime favor capacity, as my grandmother used to say. But she never elaborated. So try something for me, will ya? <split butt_txt=\"Anything.\" \/> Collect as many <b>Emblems<\/b> as it takes to increase your favor capacity to 1600. Then accrue 1511 favor points for whichever <b>Giant<\/b> you please.  <split butt_txt=\"1511?!?\" \/> Yup, 1511. Then spend them all at once on speeding up learning a skill. Which skill? Well, I'll leave that up to you. I'm easy like that.";
