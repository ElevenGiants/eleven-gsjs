Well, don't worry—I'm not going to shrink you down or send you into some spooky woods or make you ride a roller-skating camel again.<split butt_txt=\"I've never ridden a roller-skating camel.\" \/>Really? Well maybe we haven't done that one yet. Anyway, this time we're going to the museum in the Mezzanine of Jethimadh Tower, accessible from <a href=\"event:location|71#LIF5UU8FO3029OK\">Tower St. West<\/a>. We're going to learn about the Rook. <split butt_txt=\"Not the Rook!\" \/>Yes, but don't worry. The museum is perfectly safe. For legal reasons, though, just on the outside chance that something even slightly bad happens, you'll need to get your parents to sign some indemnity forms. <split butt_txt=\"Do I even have parents?\" \/>Good point. Well, I'm sure it'll be fine. Like I said, the chances are extremely low that you'll be horrifically mangled beyond recognition, so get a move on, champ!";

How may I be of service?<split butt_txt=\"A magic rock told me talk to you.\" \/>Then it is time: time for you to learn of the Rook! Time for you to take up the fight against those dreadful beasts, the fight for imagination—nay, for Ur itself!<split butt_txt=\"Me?\" \/>Yes, for if not you, then who else?";
